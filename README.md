# Sentiment_Analysis_with_BERT

## Project Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify user reviews from the Google Play Store into three sentiment categories: negative, neutral, and positive. The model leverages the power of BERT to understand the context of words in sentences, providing accurate sentiment predictions.

## Objectives
- Build a sentiment analysis model using BERT.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a dataset of Google Play app reviews.
- Provide insights into the model's predictions and potential applications.
